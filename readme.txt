Easily embed Easy Video Player videos and audio into WordPress posts, even with the visual editor!

== Description ==

EasyVideoPlayer 2.0 (EVP 2) is a great video player. EVP makes it easy to create your own videos with calls to action that integrate with your email marketing providers, such as Constant Contact or iContact.

###Embed the Easy Video Player code in the Visual Editor###
This plugin allows you to embed EVP videos into the Visual Editor and the Code Editor. They won't be stripped out of the Visual Editor as they used to be!

Using EasyVideoPlayer with WordPress used to be hard - you could only embed the code in the HTML Editor, and the code would disappear when switching to the visual editor. No longer: <strong>the EasyVideoPlayer WordPress plugin works in both the Visual and HTML Editors.</strong>

###Built-in Video SEO!
Get video SEO for your EVP videos. By using this EasyVideoPlayer WordPress plugin, Google-friendly code will be added to your video. "Rich snippets" (microformats) data will automatically be added to your page. You won't need to do a thing, and your videos will be better optimized.

###EasyVideoPlayer features:###
